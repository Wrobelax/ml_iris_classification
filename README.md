## **Project description**
This project utilises iris data from sklearn module, manipulates it, trains ml model and uses for prediction models visualization.
The data used in the project is pretty simple and covers only 150 cases (rows).


### Features


### Tech Stack
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

- Sklearn


### Project structure


### Data description
* "petal_visualisation.png": Basic visualization of the iris data before any train or test.
* "conf_matrix_log_reg.png": Visualization of a confusion matrix for logistic regression prediction model. It shows where the model is and isn't accurate.
  * **Conclusion:** 'versicolor' class is confused with 'virginica' sometimes.
* "conf_matrix_rand_forest.png": Visualization of a confusion matrix for random forest prediction model. It shows where the model is and isn't accurate.
  * **Conclusion:** Logistic regression and random forest confusion matrix are the same. It shows that both work fine on the dataset.
